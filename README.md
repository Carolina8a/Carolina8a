# Caro's Workhouse 

Hi there! My name is caro! I am a 20 years old and I am proudly mexican. :mexico:

## Description

I study Engineering in Digital Transformation at Tecnologico de Monterrey; where it seeks to combine technology and business knowledge to further improve upon businesses. I have only completed my first year.
I am currently working on Web Development, but I would like to go into data analysis; through webdev I am able to do client relationship management as well as a variation of data anaylsis but I am currently working to earn a certificate, 


### Experience

I decided to futher my knowledge because I was not satisfied with what I was learning so I decided to seek out more.
* I got a front-end certificate with basic CSS, HTML and Javascript. From there, I decided to learn bootstrap and am currently learning react and t3 stack (next.js in a nutshell).
* I got a work opportunity and created my first front-end website; where I worked closely with hubspot for CRM analysis. I work closely with a hubspot mentor and SEO specialist; where I am learning lots from and expanding my knowledge of SEO. 


# PROJECTS

### My first ever website 

While doing the certificate I made my website that was about dogs which connected to a dog API and it makes a random list of dogs where you can learn more by clicking on. I am not hosting the page anywhere, but here is a view of what it looks like in the shared video file below.
